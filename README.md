# Learning Project: VueJS3 Forum, Composition API Version

This project is a skills exercise to gain an expert level of ability with the VueJs3 Composition API and Ecosystem.

In order to sharpen my skills with VueJS3 and its Composition API, I completed the VueJS Masterclass, translating the Options API as demonstrated in the tutorials into the modern Composition API.

The final product can be explored here:

Note that this product follows the UX flow and capability that was provided by the class syllabus. It is problematic for a real-world Forum application; what feels like a confusing bug is likely a feature of the very basic UX design. Don't hold that against me ;)

I hope that others who step through this course material may find this useful and may find some clues to solve difficult challenges. That said, please endeavour to reason through those issues yourself; you will be much further ahead than peeking at the answers ;)
